        <p class="md:leading-loose leading-relaxed text-justify mb-5">Create My Health CIC is dedicated to advancing a healthcare approach that shifts the paradigm from treating disease to actively co-creating health. Our goal is to establish local-community health hubs throughout Leeds that offer integrated and holistic health care to all. These hubs will constitute a network that encourages, supports and empowers everyone to take responsibility for their health in a way that works for them.</p>
        <p class="md:leading-loose leading-relaxed text-justify">Create My Health is proud to be a member of the PHA (People’s Health Alliance).</p>

        <p class="md:leading-loose leading-relaxed mb-5 text-justify">Most of us experience healthcare as reactive rather than pro-active. We have become dependent on a medical system that manages symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of disease. Create My Health CIC is a people-led grassroots organisation that views health as far more than symptom management. We believe true health flourishes through an integrative approach that considers mind, body and spirit in unity.</p>
        <p class="md:leading-loose leading-relaxed mb-5 text-justify">Create My Health CIC aims to create a resilient and easy-to-access healthcare network, in which practitioners from different modalities understand each others’ approaches and expertise, thereby ensuring timely and appropriate cross-referral when necessary. Moreover, Create My Health CIC endeavours to inspire each individual to actively create their own health by sharing knowledge and experience through peer-support circles, wellbeing days, health ‘cafés’ and a myriad of other fun and informative outreach events.</p>
        <p class="md:leading-loose leading-relaxed text-justify">Create My Health firmly believes in inclusivity and equal access for all, and aims to provide products and services at a reduced cost or free of charge, depending on each individual’s financial situation.</p>
